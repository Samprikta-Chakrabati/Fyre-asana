        <h3>Asanas</h3>
        <p>Asana is the physical practice of yoga and relates to the body. Asana is also another name for the poses or postures of yoga.Most modern practitioners initially come to yoga by doing yoga postures or yoga asana. But yoga asana is not yoga. An asana is simply a physical shape that you do with your body.<br><br>We use yoga poses to do yoga. But the yoga poses themselves are not yoga.</p>
